# Xolphin API wrapper for PHP

xolphin-php-api is a library which allows quick integration of the [Xolphin REST API](https://api.xolphin.com) in PHP to
automated ordering, issuance and installation of SSL Certificates.

## About Xolphin

[Xolphin](https://www.xolphin.nl/) is the largest supplier of [SSL Certificates](https://www.sslcertificaten.nl)
and [Digital Signatures](https://www.digitalehandtekeningen.nl) in the Netherlands. Xolphin has a professional team
providing reliable support and rapid issuance of SSL Certificates at an affordable price from industry leading brands
such as Sectigo, GeoTrust, GlobalSign, Thawte and Symantec.

## Library installation

Library can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

```
composer require xolphin/xolphin-api-php
```

And updated via

```
composer update xolphin/xolphin-api-php
```

### Upgrade guide: from v2.x to v3.x
- Access pagination attributes from `$response->getPagination()->{{method}};`
- Remove all EE (EncryptionEverywhere) blocks from your code, it has finally been removed.
- Make sure you enforce the right types since we enforce strict-typing now.

### Upgrade guide from v1.8.3 to v2.x

Update your `xolphin/xolphin-api-php` dependency to `^2.0` in your `composer.json` file.

#### Renamed classes

All endpoint classes have been renamed to a more generic name `<resource>Endpoint`. You should update your usages.

#### Calling Endpoint classes

All endpoint classes are started during startup They can be called using `$client->certificates->all()` instead
of `$client->certificate()->all()`.

#### Using Helpers instead of strings

In version 2.0.0 we introduced Helper classes. These classes contain constants of all static string variables (enums).
Use these constants instead of a string, because we will alter these constants whenever we change the corresponding
value in the API.

For instance, when creating a DCV for a domain:

```php
$dcvDomain = new Xolphin\Requests\DCVDomain('someDomain', Xolphin\Helpers\DCVTypes::EMAIL_VALIDATION, 'someemail@address.com');
```

#### Certificate download() method returns string

The method `download()` on the class `CertificatesEndpoint` now returns the certificate string instead of
the `GuzzlestreamInterface`.

## Usage

### Client initialization

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Xolphin\Client('<username>', '<password>');
```

When needed, you are able to provide a custom GuzzleHttp client when initializing the Xolphin client:

```php
$client = new Xolphin\Client(httpClient: new GuzzleHttp\Client([
    ...
]));
```

While this feature can be useful for applying your own middleware, make sure to also implement the authentication yourself.

### Rate Limiting

#### Current limit

```php
$limit = $client->getLimit();
echo $limit . PHP_EOL;
```

#### Requests remaining for limit

```php
$requestsRemaining = $client->getRequestsRemaining();
echo $requestsRemaining . PHP_EOL;
```

### Requests

$requests = $client->requests->all();
foreach($requests as $request) {
    echo $request->id . PHP_EOL;
}
